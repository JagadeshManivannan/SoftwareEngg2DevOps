Test plan


2.1 Test items


The items to be tested consist of the integration of the code modules developed, for the
Power Enjoy project. For testing we choose the bottom-up approach. This means that integration
testing starts at the bottom  level.We chose this because the top level component when built 
has to be tested from the bottom level components in your project (i.e) we can simply say that it has few dependencies 
on the bottom level components for testing.Even though, it can be developed by creating stubs, we do not prefer that.
We want to test using the real values and functionalities. The integration tests described in this documents are at the component
level. The integration tests of lower level code modules are described in the corresponding
components unit test. Unit tests are described in the [UTP].


2.2 Features to be tested

Figures 2.1 and 2.2 shows the component level diagrams that forms the Power Enjoy system.
The arrows represent the order of integration, i.e. integration testing.




Integration Tests of the Controller Software:

ID			Integaration Test																	Paragraphs
I1		Database--->Availability Helper
I2		Availability Helper--->Selection Controller
I3		Availability Helper--->Reservation Controller
I4		Availability Helper--->Parking Controller
I5		Selection Controller,Reservation Controller,Parking Controller,
		Ride Controller,Discounts Controller--->Map Manager
I6		Map Manager--->Client Application





Integration Tests of the Notification Software:


ID			Integaration Test																	Paragraphs

I7		SMS Gateway--->Notification Helper
I8		PUSH Gateway--->Notification Helper
I9		Notification Helper--->Map Manager


2.3 Test deliverables

The following items must be delivered before integration testing can begin:
* The Detailed Design Document [DDD].
* Chapters 1, 2, 3 and 4 of this document.

The following items must be delivered before a specific integration test can begin:

* Input data for this specific integration test.
* The components involved.
* Integration test report, which will be listed in the integration tests paragraph in chapter
  5 of this document.
* Integration test output data.
* Problem reports (if necessary).

The following items must be delivered when testing on all code modules has finished:
* All integration test reports, which comprises chapter 5 of this document.


2.4 Testing tasks

The following tasks are necessary for performing a specific integration test:
* Designing the integration test.
* Designing input test data (if it was not made at the unit test).
* Setting up a system, the components involved,and the input test data.
* Performing the integration test.


2.5 Test case pass/fail criteria
Every test case must describe what the criteria are to pass that specific test.
