\chapter{Program stubs and test data required}

As we have mentioned in the Integration Testing Strategy section, we adopted the bottom-up approach for the components integration and testing. For this reason the usage of stubs is minimized, but a few number of drivers is needed to perform the necessary method invocations of the integrated components that are going to be tested.

Below the reader can find the list of the required drivers for the integration test plan.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{AvailabilityHelper driver}. This testing module will invoke the methods exposed by the AvailabilityHelper component in order to test its interaction with the database management system
	\item \emph{Controllers driver}. This testing module will invoke the methods exposed by the Controllers (acting like MapManager) in order to test its interaction with each other.A stub acting like the Client is needed to fulfill the request/response protocol needed for client/system interaction
\end{itemize}
