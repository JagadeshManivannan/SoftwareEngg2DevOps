2.2 Indention:

 \item \ The entire code given for inspection is indented properly with not more than 4 spaces and no tabs were used.
  
2.5 Wrapping lines:

 \item \textbf{C17- L161} The "else if" statement is not aligned with the beginning of the expression at the same level. 
as the previous line. 
	
\item \textbf{C17- L132,88,179,186,196,205,276,308,430,462} The "catch" statement is not aligned at the same level. This could be avoided either during the 
code development by proper checking.

\item \textbf{C17- L189,350,360,506,516}The "else" statement is not aligned at the same level. This could be avoided either during the 
code development by proper checking.



2.8 Package and import statements:
 
\item  The package and import statements were found in the correct order as per the code inspection document.
 
 
 2.9 Class and Interface Declarations

\item The class or interface declarations order is followed correctly.

\item \textbf{C27- L-224,378} Both the "switch" blocks are a copy paste in our service which paves way for duplicates. But this is quite preferrable 
here rather than using different piece of code for the same logical implementation (i.e. for a better understanding).

\item \textbf{C27- L218,271,301,344,372,425,455,500) All the methods are long(more than 10 lines and some mothods are even more than 20 lines.
This should be optimized by using fewer conditional checks covering all the requirements.

\item \textbf{C26}- All the methods are grouped by functionality rather than by scope or accessibility.

(E) INSTANCE VARIABLES;-L-220-HERE THE INSTANCE VARIABLES SHOULD BE PLACED ONE LINE BEFORE THE MAP DECLARATION.-- NOT SURE.

2.14 OUTPUT FORMAT

 \item The error messages are comprehensive and are in-line as per the code inspection document.
  
 2.17Flow of control:
 
 \item  All swich statements are addressed by a break.
 
\item \textbf{C55-L-224,378} There is no default branch for any of the swith statements. The solutions we suggest for this problem is to leave the code 
undisturbed, because all the days are present in the switch cases such that it executes any one of the switch case and so no default is needed. Without
knowing the dayStart or dayEnd it would be wrong to define a default branch here.

 	
Other Errors found during Code inspection:

Imports:
 
 \item \textbf{General-L261,284,317,328,415,438,471,483} - no import statement used for Integer. Import that has to be used here was: java.lang.Integer or import java.lang.* can be used .
 \item \textbf{General-L221,287,356,375,441,472,512}- no import for Double was done. java.lang.Double or import java.lang.* could have solved the issue.
 \item \textbf{General-L-418,448,264,394,336}-TechDataCalenda- the spelling has to be corrected here.
