		Goals:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \([\)G1] Registration of a user to the system
			\item \([\)G2] Finding the locations of the available cars
			\item \([\)G3] Reservation of a car
			\item \([\)G4] Expiration of reservation and penalization
			\item \([\)G5] Entry of registered user into the car
			\item \([\)G6] Start charging and notifying the registered user
			\item \([\)G7] Stop charging the registered user and lock the car
			\item \([\)G8] Safe areas for parking the reserved cars
			\item \([\)G9] Detection of extra passengers and applying discount
			\item \([\)G10] Detection of the battery status and applying discount
			\item \([\)G11] Detection of special parking areas and applying discount
			\item \([\)G12] Checking parking and battery constraints and penalization
		\end{itemize}
	
		\column{.45\textwidth}
		Domain properties:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item User's data are always valid.
			\item Location reported by the GPS is always accurate.
			\item Every user can reserve just a car per time.
			\item The service is only available to validated users.
			\item The service has employees to move the cars if their distribution in the map is unbalanced.
			\item The license office provides the online service to let the system instantly check the user's documents during the registration.
			\item If the user's driver license expires, he gets unvalidated until he renew it.
			\item A call center is provided by the service to handle difficult situations.

	\frametitle{Requirements}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The system needs to provide mandatory sign up and payment options or the guest users who wants to register to use the car sharing service.
		\item Once the payment is successful and the guest user is registered, the registered user receives a password that can be used to access (login into) the system.
		\item The system needs to provide the exact location of the cars that are available within a certain distance either from the current location of the registered users or from a specified address given(entered) by the registered users.
		\item The system provides provision such that the registered users must be able to reserve only a single car among the available cars in a certain geographical region for up to one hour before they pick it up.
		\item The system checks if a reserved car is picked-up within one hour. If not, the system tags the car as available again and the reservation expires.
		\item The system penalizes the registered user who made the reservation and did not pick the reserved car within an hour, by making him to pay a fee of 1EUR.
