2.4 Sequence of Component/Function Integration


In this section we are going to describe the order of integration (and integra-
tion testing) of the various components and subsystems of Power Enjoy.
As a notation, an arrow going from component C1 to component C2 means that C1 is necessary for C2 to function and so it must have already been
implemented.

2.4.1 Software Integration Sequence

Following the already mentioned bottom-up approach, we now describe how
the various subcomponents are integrated together to create higher level
subsystems.

Database Management System

The very basic elements that needs to be integrated and tested are Database and Availability Helper.We test this first because of the bottom up approach and
all the other subsystems components relies in this structure.

Controller  System
The secons step is the integration of the components of the Controller System. Most of the important operations are assumed to be executed/performed
by the components of the controller system. We proceed further by showing which components are executed or integrated in sequence.

First,we proceed by integrating the Selection Controller with the DB and availability helper.

Then the same procedure is followed by replacing the selection controller with other components of the controller system in the following sequence: Reservation Controller,
Ride controller,Parking Controller, Discount Controller.

Map Manager System

Generally the communication between the controllers happens through the Map Manager. So, the Map Manager has to be integrated with the Controllers for their 
communication and also for interaction of the Client with the system.

Notification System

The next integration test is executed with the notification system. This notification system is developed by the third party and we just integrate and test here 
the functionalities.For example: After reserving a car, the user is notified with a confirmation acknowledgement.

Payment System

The payment system is same like the notification system as it is developed by the third party and we just integrate and test here the functionalities.

Account Manager System

After the integration of the above systems , the account manager is integrated and tested here. The account manager has informatioon about the user detials and allows
him/her to edit personal informations, upload documents and other services.

SUBSYSTEM INTEGRATION SEQUENCE

Finally test integrate and test the CLIENT system with the overall integrated systems. The high level sybsystems are integrated together and 
the integration architecture of the Power Enjoy service is shown here.
