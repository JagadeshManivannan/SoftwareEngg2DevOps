\section{Cost and effort estimation}
In this section we are going to use the COCOMO II approach to estimate the
cost and effort needed to develop the PowerEnJoy application.

\subsection{Scale drivers}
In order to evaluate the values of the scale drivers, we refer to the following official COCOMO II table:

A brief description for each scale driver:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{Precedentedness}: this factor determines or reveals the level of exposure or experience in development of large scale projects or similar kind of projects that out team has done before. Since we have developed few projects like this, we can set this value to be Nominal.
	\item \emph{Development flexibility}: it determines the degree of flexibility in the development process with respect to the external specification and requirements. In our project, the functionalities and requirements are clear and well defined with no specific mention about the technology. Hence this value would be low.
	\item \emph{Architecture/Risk resolution}: it determines the level of awareness and reactivity with
respect to risks. Since we have an extremely good risk management plan, we consider this value to be very high.
	\item \emph{Team cohesion}: it determines if all the Stakeholders are able to work in a team and share same vision and commitment. Since our team is highly co-operative,
	the value is very high.
	\item \emph{Process maturity}: we have a done an extremely fair work to meet our goals successfully in this project. Since we had prior experience in successfully dealing these kind of projects, the value is set to Level 4.
\end{itemize}

The results of our evaluation is the following:

\begin{table}[H]

\subsection{Cost drivers}

\subsubsection{Product factors}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{Required Software Reliability (RELY)}:
	\begin{itemize}
			\item[] The software application is developed in such a way that the main aim is to reserve and take a ride in the Cars in the city. Any malfunctioning could lead to important financial loss. Considering this, the RELY cost driver is set to high.

\end{table}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{Database size (DATA)}:
	\begin{itemize}
		 \item[] This factor considers the effective size of our database. We do'nt know this value exactly. But based on the lower and upper bound
values of the SLOC, which is 10.000-15.000 SLOC, we can estimate roughly that our system can reach a 3GB database size. Since it is
distributed over 10.000-15.000 SLOC, the ratio D/P (measured as testing DB bytes/program SLOC) is between 209 and 314,
resulting in the DATA cost driver being high.
	\end{itemize}

	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Effort equation}
This final equation gives us the effort estimation measured in Person-Months (PM):
\[ Effort = A \times EAF \times KSLOC^E \]
where:
\begin{nospaceflalign*}
	& A = 2.94 \textnormal{ (for COCOMO II)} \phantom{\sum} \\
	& EAF = 1.13694 \textnormal{ (product of all cost drivers)} \\
	& E = B + 0.01 \times \sum_{i} SF[i] = B + 0.01 * 11.84 = 0.91 + 0.1464 = 1.0284 \\
	& \textnormal{(exponent derived from the scale drivers, with B = 0.91 for COCOMO II)} \\
\end{nospaceflalign*}

With this parameters we can compute the effort value, which has a lower
bound of:
\begin{nospaceflalign*}
	Effort = A \times EAF \times KSLOC^E & = 2.94 \times 1.13694 \times dash^{1.0284} \\
	& = 4\textnormal{ PM} \approx dash\textnormal{ PM}
\end{nospaceflalign*}
and an upper bound of:
\begin{nospaceflalign*}
	Effort = A \times EAF \times KSLOC^E & = 2.94 \times 1.13694 \times dash^{1.0284} \\
	& = 4\textnormal{ PM} \approx dash\textnormal{ PM}
\end{nospaceflalign*}

\subsection{Schedule estimation}
Regarding the final schedule, we are going to use the following formula:
\[ Duration = 3.67 \times Effort^F \]
As a lower bound, we consider
\begin{nospaceflalign*}
	& F = 0.28 + 0.2 \times (E - B) = 0.28 + 0.2 \times 0.1464 = 0.30928
\\
	& Effort = 56.957\textnormal{ PM}
\\
	& Duration = 3.67 \times 56.957^{0.30928} = 12.81\textnormal{ months} \\
\end{nospaceflalign*}
while as an upper bound, we consider
\begin{nospaceflalign*}
	& F = 0.28 + 0.2 \times (E - B) = 0.28 + 0.2 \times 0.1464 = 0.30928
\\
	& Effort = 84.737\textnormal{ PM}
\\
	& Duration = 3.67 \times 84.737^{0.30928} = 14.49\textnormal{ months}
\\
\end{nospaceflalign*}
