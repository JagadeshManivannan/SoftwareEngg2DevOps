3.REQUIREMENTS

The following requirements have been elicited with respect to the domain properties and assumptions mentioned above in order to satisfy the goals:

  * Registration of User to the system:
		-The system needs to provide mandatory sign up and payment options for the guest users who wants to register to use the car sharing service.
		-Once the payment is successful and the guest user is registered, the registered user receives a password that can be used to access (login into) the system.

  * Finding the location of the available cars:
		-The system needs to provide the EXACT location of the cars that are available within a certain distance either from the current location of the registered users or from a specified address given(entered) by the registered users.

  * Reservation of a car:
		-The system provides provision such that the registered users must be able to reserve only a single car among the available cars in a certain geographical region for up to one hour before they pick it up.
		
  * Expiry of reservation and penalization:
		-The system checks if a reserved car is picked-up within one hour.
		-If not, the system tags the car as available again AND the reservation expires.
		-The system penalizes the registered user who made the reservation and did not pick the reserved car within an hour, by making him to pay a fee of 1 EUR.


  * Entry of registered user into the car:
		-The system must be able to identify (communicate with) the registered user when he/she is nearby the reserved car.
		-The system unlocks the reserved car AND allows the registered user to enter it after identification of registered user as mentioned in the previous point.
	
  * Starting to charge and notify the registered user:
		-The system starts charging the registered user for a given amount of money per minute as soon as the engine is ignited.
		-The system must be able to notify the current charges to the registered user through a screen on the reserved car.

  *  Stop charging the registered user and lock the car:
		-The system must stop charging the registered user as soon as the reserved car is parked in a safe area and the registered user exits the reserved car.
		-The system must be able to lock the reserved car automatically at this point after the above operation is successfully done.
* Safe areas for parking the reserved cars:
		The safe areas are defined by the systems as follows:
*   Those areas predefined by the system in and around a specific geographical region (green areas displayed in the user interface screen)
	The parking areas which are not private and located in the basement (underground).
	The parking area in which the GPS signals are not very low (the system must suggest the user in this case).

In order to the above requirements, the system should incentivize/motivate the virtuous behaviors of the registered user by satisfying the following requirements:
* Detection of extra passengers and applying discount:
		-The system must detect if the registered user has taken at least two other passengers onto the reserved car. 
		-The system must calculate and apply a discount of 10% on the last ride if the above-mentioned point is true or satisfied.



* Detection of the battery status and applying discount:
		-The system must detect the percentage of the battery charge that has been consumed in the reserved car by the registered user during the last ride.
		-The system must calculate and apply a discount of 20% if the reserved car is left with no more than 50% of the battery empty.
*Detection of special parking areas and applying discount:
		-The system should detect if the reserved car is left in the special parking areas-where they can be recharged and the registered user takes care of plugging the car into the power grid.
		-The system must calculate and apply a discount of 30% on the last ride if the above check is true or satisfied.

*Checking constraints and penalization: 
		-The system must check if either of the following conditions are true:
	The distance between the reserved car (parked after the ride) and the nearest power grid station is more than 3KM (Kilometers).
	The battery of the reserved car (parked after the ride) is consumed more than 80%.
-The system must penalize the registered user by charging 30% more on the last ride if either of the two conditions mentioned above are true to compensate for the cost required to recharge the reserved car (parked after the ride).

*Enabling of money saving option and ensuring even distribution of reserved cars:
		-The system should provide a functionality to allow the registered user to enable the money saving option, upon which he/she can input his/her final destination.
		-After receiving the inputs from the registered user, the system must provide information about the station where to leave the reserved car to get a discount.
		-The system must also ensure uniform distribution of the reserved cars in the city based on both the destination of the registered user and on the availability of the power plugs at selected station.
