2.2 Cost and Effort estimation: COCOMO II

Here, in this section we are going to use the COCOMO II approach to estimate the
cost and effort needed to develop Power Enjoy application.


2.2.1 Scale Drivers

In order to evaluate the values of the scale drivers, we refer to the following offcial COCOMO II table:


								Scale Factor values, SFj , for COCOMO II Models

USE THE TABLE WHICH ALREADY EXISTS

A brief description for each scale driver:

*Precedentedness: This factor determines or reveals the level of exposure or experience in development of large scale projects or similar kind of 
projects that out team has done before. Since we have developed few projets like this,we can set this value to be Nominal.

*Development flexibility:It determines the degree of fexibility in the development process with respect to the external specification and requirements.
In our project, the functionalities and requirements are clear and well defined with no specific mention about the technology.Hence this value would be low.

*Architecture / Risk Resolution: It determines the level of awareness and reactiveness with
respect to risks.Since we have an extremely good risk management plan, we consider this value to be very high.

*Team Cohesion: It determines if all the Stakeholders aree able to work in a team and share same vision and commitment.Since our team is highly co-operative,
the value is very high.

*Process Maturity:We have a done an extremely fair work to meet our goals successfully in this project. Since we had prior experience in 
successfully dealing these kind of projects, the value is set to Level 4.

The results of our evaluation is the following:


Scale Driver 							Factor 					Value
Precedentedness(PREC) 					Nominal 				3.72
Development flexibility(FLEX) 			Low 					4.05
Risk resolution (RESL) 					Very high 				1.41
Team cohesion (TEAM) 					Very high				1.10
Process maturity (PMAT) 				Level 4 				1.56
Total 															11.84


2.2.2 Cost Drivers


PRODUCT FACTORS:-

*Required Software Reliability(RELY):
The software application is developed in such a way that the main aim is to reserve and take a ride in the Cars in the city. Any malfunctioning 
could lead to important financial loss. Considering this, the RELY cost driver is set to high.

51*133=6738 , upper bound = 73*133=9709

Database size(DATA):
This factor considers the effective size of our database. We do'nt know this value exactly.But based on the lower and upper bound
values of the SLOC, which is 6738-9709 SLOC, we can estimate roughly that our system can reach a 3GB database size. Since it is
distributed over 6738-9709 SLOC, the ratio D/P (measured as testing DB bytes/program SLOC) is between 182 and 276,
resulting in the DATA cost driver being high.

	often except for very few major releases or updated requested by the client.This will be done approximately for every 5months to be in sync with 
	the latest evolving or trending technologies.Hence, the PVOL cost driver is set to nominal.

GENERAL FACTOR:-

*Required Development Schedule (SCED):
The efforts was distributedor split equally in our project for all the documentation, yet there were certain time consuming process in analysing and 
development of the RASD and the DD documents for precision. Hence, the  SCED cost driver is set to be high.

2.2.3 Effort Equation


This final equation gives us the effort estimation measured in Person-Months(PM):

Effort = A * EAF * KSLOC^E

where:
A = 2.94 ( for COCOMO II )
EAF = product of all cost drivers(1.13694)
E = exponent derived from the scale drivers. It is computed as :
B + 0.01 * (Summation symbol) SF[i] = B + 0.01 * 11.84 = 0.91 + 0.1184 =1.0284  	//[PLEASE SEE THE FORMULA FROM EXAMPLE]
in which B is equal to: 0.91 for COCOMO II .

With this parameters we can compute the effort value, which has a lower
bound of:

Effort = A * EAF * KSLOC^E = 2.94 * 1.13694 *  6.738   ^1.0284 =   23.77   PM (equivalent symbol) 24 PM

and an upper bound of:

Effort = A * EAF * KSLOC^E = 2.94 * 1.13694 *   9.709  ^1.0284 =  34.61     PM (equivalent symbol) 35 PM



2.2.4 Schedule estimation

Regarding the final schedule, we are going to use the following formula:

Duration = 3.67 * Effort^F

As a lower bound, we consider

F = 0.28 + 0 . 2 * (E - B) = 0.28 + 0 . 2 * 0.1184 = 0.31368
Effort = 23.77 PM
Duration = 3.67 * ( 23.77 )^ 0.31368 = 9.91 months

while as an upper bound, we consider

F = 0.28 + 0 . 2 * (E - B) = 0.28 + 0 . 2 * 0.11844 = 0.31368
Effort = 34.61 PM
Duration = 3.67 * (34.61)^ 0.31368 = 11.15 months

which seems to be reasonable estimates. Thanks to COCOMO 2.
