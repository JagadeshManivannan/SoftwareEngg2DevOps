1.Introduction
1.1.Purpose
The purpose of this document is to give more technical details than the RASD about PowerEnJoy system.
This document is addressed to developers and aims to identify:
 The high level architecture.
* The design patterns.
* The main components and their interfaces provided one for another.
* The Runtime behavior.


1.2.Scope

The project PowerEnJoy, which is a service based on mobile application and web application, has two different targets of people:
* An unregistered user (public).
* The Client (registered user).
The system allows clients to reserve a taxi via a mobile or web app, using his GPS position to find an available Car nearby.
It also allows the  client to reserve an available car, get discounts for efficeient usage and other services.
The unregistered user is allowed only to register/SignUp to the PowerEnJoy system to enjoy its services.
The main purpose of the system is to be more efficient, reliable and offer a better service to the clients by faster response by reducing the response time.



1.3.Definitions, acronyms, abbreviations
* RASD: requirements analysis and specifications document.
* DD: design document.
* SMS Notification: short message service; it is a notification sent to a mobile phone, an SMS gateway is needed to use it.
* SMS gateway: it is a service which allows to send SMS via standard API.
* API: application programming interface; it is a common way to communicate with another system.
* MVC: model view controller.
* URL: uniform resource locator.
* Push notification: it is a notification sent to a smartphone using the mobile application, so it must be installed.
* Push service: it is a service that allows to send push notifications with own API.
* REST: REpresantional State Transfer.
* RESTful: REST with no session.
* UX: user experience design.
* BCE: business controller entity.

1.5.Document structure


* Introduction: this section introduces the design document. It contains a justification of his utility and indications on which parts are covered in
this document that are not covered by RASD.
* Architecture Design: this section is divided into different parts:

1. Overview : this sections explains the division in tiers of our application.
2. High level components and their interaction : this sections gives a global view of the components of the application and how they communicate.
3. Component view : this sections gives a more detailed view of the components of the applications.
4. Deploying view : this section shows the components that must be deployed to have the application running correctly.
5. Runtime view : sequence diagrams are represented in this section to show the course of the different tasks of our application.
6. Component interfaces : the interfaces between the components are presented in this section.
7. Selected architectural styles and patterns : this section explain the architectural choices taken during the creation of the application.
8. Other design decisions:
* Algorithms Design: this section describes the most critical parts via some algorithms. Pseudo code is used in order to hide unnecessary implementation
details in order to focus on the most important parts.
* User Interface Design: this section presents mockups and user experience explained via UX and BCE diagrams.
* Requirements Traceability: this section aims to explain how the decisions taken in the RASD are linked to design elements.
